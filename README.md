# Prework-study-guide

## Description 

The motive of creating this project is to help other begginner coders or students learn tne basics and understanding of coding
I made this project to help others with notes intact to assist other bootcamp students or people in genral to learn and study coding
this project could help hundreads or thousands of begginer students in coding when it comes to this study guide wheather its a test or just basics of creating an application 
I learned the basics and steps to create a unique website through the terminal with understanding the language and what it takes to make an application which includes the html,javasript,git,readme and the funcionality that a computer can do with simple but effective way to be creative in todays society also what it takes to

## Installation

first step to intalling this application is creatong the html on Visual studio and downloading necssary items in the prework file that contains the html , image, to start the application off once thats downloaded move to the visual studios app on your computer and add the following code to the html    

html lang="en">
  <head><link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css">
    <title>Prework Study Guide</title>

  Second step is to create the Css style sheet for color and font style with borders as well to make it look neat as such move to visual studio and create a css style sheet in file go to terminal and create a new branch feature/add-css to the prework-study-guide file then it will be open on visual studios and input the code as it is below. 

  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
} 

header,
footer {
    width: 100%;
    height: 120px;
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}

h1,
h2 {
    text-align: center;
}
img {
    display: block;
    height: 50px;
    width: 50px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}


ul {
    padding-left: 40px;
    font-size: 20px;
}

p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 30px;
  }

  .card {
    width: 80%;
    margin: 40px auto;
    border: 5px solid gray;
    box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888;
  }    
The third step is to create a java script with the terminal adding a feature to the code to make it easier for the reader or user to understand the concepts while fixing the bugs on java script use this code as an example to start off your application

const topics = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', 'JavaScript'];
const randomTopic = topics[Math.floor(Math.random() * topics.length)];

function listTopics() {
  for (let x = 0; x < topics.length; x++) {
  console.log(topics[x]);
 }
}
